# FIFO Verification Project (UVM-lite) 

This project implements and verifies a parameterized FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer using **SystemVerilog**. The design is simulated in **ModelSim** and verified using a simplified **UVM-lite** testbench architecture. It serves as a personal project for learning and showcasing key skills in RTL design, constrained-random verification, and modular testbench development.
